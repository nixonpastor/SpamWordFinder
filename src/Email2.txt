Updating Our Terms of Service
We’re improving our Terms of Service and making them easier for you to understand. The changes will take effect on March 31, 2020, and they won’t impact the way you use Google services.
For more details, we’ve provided a summary of the key changes and Frequently Asked Questions. At a glance, here’s what this update means for you:
Improved readability: While our Terms remain a legal document, we’ve done our best to make them easier to understand, including by adding links to useful information and providing definitions.
Better communication: We’ve clearly explained when we’ll make changes to our services (like adding or removing a feature) and when we’ll restrict or end a user’s access. And we’ll do more to notify you when a change negatively impacts your experience on our services.
Adding Google Chrome, Google Chrome OS and Google Drive to the Terms: Our improved Terms now cover Google Chrome, Google Chrome OS, and Google Drive, which also have service-specific terms and policies to help you understand what’s unique to those services.
No changes to our Privacy Policy: We’re not making any changes to the Google Privacy Policy and we haven't made any changes to the way we treat your information. As a reminder, you can always visit your Google Account to review your privacy settings and manage how your data is used.
If you’re the guardian of a child under the age required to manage their own Google Account and you use Family Link to manage their use of Google services, please take some time to discuss these changes with them.
And of course, if you don’t agree to our new Terms and what we can expect from each other as you use our services, you can find more information about your options in our Frequently Asked Questions.
Thank you for using Google’s services.
